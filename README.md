# DemoLearningRepo
This is a learning demo repository, following FaradayAcademy's Git and Github Crash Course.
Yeah. That's it. What do you expect?

## What I learned
- Using VS Code's terminal to run git commands and clone a GitHub repository to local machine.<br />
- Also, I learned that the syntax for headers and subheaders is #.<br />
- "-m" is for message, when committing changes to the repository, a message is required. The message can be a single letter, or  something else. Also, adding another "-m" is for adding a description.<br />
- Committing changes only saves the changes to the local repository, not the remote one. To push changes to the remote repository, use "git push".<br />
- GitHub Copilot is very useful in predicting and filling your next line.
