# DemoLearningRepo
This is a learning demo repository, following FaradayAcademy's Git and Github Crash Course.
Yeah. That's it. What do you expect?

## What I learned
Using VS Code's terminal to run git commands and clone a GitHub repository to local machine.
Also, I learned that the syntax for headers and subheaders is #.
"-m" is for message, when committing changes to the repository, a message is required. The message can be a single letter, or something else.
